@article{Crompton2006,
   abstract = {Although work–life ‘balance’ is an EU policy priority, within Europe there are considerable variations in the nature and extent of supports that national governments have offered to dual-earner families. In general, the Nordic welfare states offer the highest level of supports, although other countries, such as France, have historically offered extensive childcare supports to working mothers. We examine national variations in reported levels of work–life conflict, drawing upon questions fielded in the 2002 Family module International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) surveys for Britain, France, Finland, Norway and Portugal. We find evidence of a ‘societal effect’ in the cases of Finland and Norway, in that significantly lower levels of work–life conflict are reported in these countries even after a range of factors have been controlled for. However, support for childcare in France does not appear to have had a similar impact. Further explorations of the data reveal that the domestic division of labour is relatively traditional in France, and that this is associated with higher levels of work–life conflict.},

   abstract = {This paper examines the impact of burnout at work (BO), work life balance (WLB), work life conflict (WLC) and job satisfaction (JS) on turnover intensions (TOI) among doctors in Pakistan. The research team developed a conceptual model to test the hypothesized relationships between the variables. Simple random sampling method was used to distribute 300 questionnaires among MBBS qualified doctors working in the private and public sector hospitals in major cities of Pakistan, such as Peshawar, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad. With a response rate of 58.3%, 175 valid responses were received which comprised sample size of this study. The research team used SPSS 15.0 and Amos 16.0 for data analysis and model testing. The study concludes that there is no significant effect of burnout at work, work life balance and work life conflict on doctors' turnover intentions. There is no significant affect of burnout at work on doctors' work life balance whereas it has a significant effect on the work life conflict and job satisfaction of doctors. Moreover, work life balance has no significant affect on job satisfaction of doctors whereas work life conflict does have a significant effect on job satisfaction of doctors. Lastly, job satisfaction has a significant effect on turnover intentions of doctors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

   abstract = {This research paper explores the quality of work life in private and public sector hospitals in vijayawada. The aim of this study is to identify the quality of work life of nurses and para-medical staff. The researcher has to highlight the factors on working conditions, work stress, job satisfaction, organizational climate and staff communication. For this study the researcher collected the data of 150 respondents (70 private sectors and 80 public sector). Likert 5 point scale is used for the questionnaire (1 indicates very poor 2. Poor 3. Average 4. Good 5. Very good). Stratified random sampling technique has been used for this study. Anova and percentage method has been used as statistical tools for this analysis. Finally the researcher has concluded his major findings. In private sector the management has to take measures on work stress, job satisfaction and staff communication. In public sector the government has to take necessary measures on working conditions, organizational climate and work stress},
